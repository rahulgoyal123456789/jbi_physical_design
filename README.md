# 🧠 JBI Physical Design Project

This project demonstrates the complete RTL-to-GDSII **Physical Design Flow** at **14nm technology node** using **Synopsys industry-standard tools**. The focus is on implementing best practices in floorplanning, power planning, placement, CTS, routing, and timing closure.

## 📂 Tools Used

- **Design Compiler (DC Shell)** – RTL Synthesis  
- **ICC2** – Floorplanning, Placement, CTS, Routing  
- **PrimeTime** – Static Timing Analysis  
- **StarRC** – Parasitic Extraction  
- *(All tools used under company-provided license)*

## 📌 Design Flow

Floorplanning → Power Planning → Placement → CTS → Routing → STA → DRC


### ✔️ Key Results
- **Very low DRC violations**
- **Minimal negative slack**
- Achieved timing closure and design signoff
