# 🔧 JBI – Physical Design Project (14nm)

This is a complete Physical Design (PD) implementation of the **JBI design** using **Synopsys industry-standard tools**. The project follows a full RTL-to-GDSII flow at the **14nm node**, incorporating best practices in floorplanning, power planning, placement, CTS, routing, and timing closure.
